Hi <%= @data[:user].first_name %>,

We’re almost ready to ship issue <%= @data[:issue_number] %> to you, part of your current subscription to <%= @data[:subscription].issues_names %> of The Manual. 

This is the shipping address we currently have for you:

<%= @data[:user].shipping_address.full_text %>

If this address is correct, there is nothing further for you to do. 

If this address is incorrect, however, please log in at https://themanual.org/account and change it. There is no password, just enter your email address (<%= @data[:user].email %>) and we’ll send you a link to log in to manage your subscription.

Thanks,

— Andy McMillan
